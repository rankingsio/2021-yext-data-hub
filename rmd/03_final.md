# Introduction 

Yext, a company providing _entreprise search_ solutions based on Natural Language Processing and AI, publish anonymized data on their [Search Data Hub](https://www.yext.com/search-data-hub). These data are samples of listing and local page data across a variety of search engines, and other digital endpoints collected by Yext from their clients. They allow for exploring insights on consumer behavior trends — including shifts in search volume and foot traffic trends by industry. 

We have analyzed these data for the industry of the Legal Services. What can we learn from Yext Search Data Hub that is relevant for personal injury lawyers? We present here our key findings.  


# Methodology
Yext kindly provided us with a subset of the data from the Search Data Hub: data about _Legal Services_ (subvertical) coming from US companies. We enriched these data with key spot comparisons observed directly on the online [Search Data Hub](https://www.yext.com/search-data-hub).  

Yext mentions that:  
"The data is comprised  comprised of a sample of listing and local page data across a variety of search engines, and other digital endpoints. Insights are shown only on a region and industry level where there are sufficient businesses, locations, and search engine data sources to maintain anonymity and privacy for Yext customers and where Yext customers have adopted the platform for a sufficient period of time to provide a meaningful comparison year over year. As data may vary between regions due to, among other things, the sample size or availability of data for certain businesses and subverticals, industry insights may not be comparable across regions."
